Indicator: A sample app created for aws starter kit by Marvell(Marvell 88MW302 Development Board)


Working: 
a) This app counts the occurence of a word in a given text. 
b) After counting the occurences, we blink the led.
c) The led is blinked the number of times the word has occured.
d) Pressing the pushbutton reiterates the wholw process.
e) A library file has been made which has the code for counting and .c file does the job of blinking the light.


Uses: This app can be used in various conditions:-
		1) As a counter for a word in a book/text.
		2) An improved version of this app can be used to 		   find out the most talked words or phrases in a 		   conversation.
		3) A better developed setup can be used for analysis 		   purposes in IoT systems.

Restrictions: We tried alot of apps having a higher difficulty level but couldn't come across any concrete app as we had not seen the board and not even a working example.
We had limited interfacing knowledge of various sensors as with the given board hence no other hardware component could be used(Though we tried a lot :p).
Even after following all the steps given in documentation the programs wouldn't get compiled on our machines without the board being attached.
